    description: "EazyPhone, a telecoms startup, needed a brand that would turn heads in an industry known for playing it safe. We built their entire brand identity from scratch — logo, colours, fonts, and social templates — creating something bold and memorable. The result? A startup ready to shake up the telecoms world with a brand that demands attention.",

    bodyText: "EazyPhone came to us with a clear vision: they didn't want to blend in. As a new player in the telecoms industry, they understood that looking like everyone else meant getting lost in the crowd. They needed an agency brave enough to help them break the mould. From day one, they were ready to take risks and stand out — they just needed the right partner to bring that boldness to life through their brand.",
    challenges: "The telecoms industry has a problem: everyone looks the same. Most companies play it safe with boring blues and predictable designs. For EazyPhone, this was both a challenge and an opportunity. As a startup, they couldn't compete on size or budget with the big players. If they looked like just another telecoms company, they'd be ignored. They needed a brand that would grab attention instantly and stick in people's minds. Without it, they'd never get noticed in such a crowded market.",
    solution: "We created a complete brand identity for EazyPhone that breaks every rule in the telecoms playbook. Starting from nothing, we built their brand from the ground up. Every element — from the logo to the colour choices to the font pairings — was designed to stand out. We gave them social media templates that keep their bold personality consistent across all platforms. The end result is exactly what they asked for: a brand that's memorable, bold, and impossible to ignore. EazyPhone now has the visual impact they need to compete with established players, proving that sometimes being different is the smartest strategy of all.",

Rather than starting from scratch, they wanted to build on what they already had — keeping the best bits of their brand while making it feel current and relevant. They needed a partner who could breathe new life into their identity without losing what made them unique.",
    challenges: "Bluestone Mortgages main challenge was clear: their brand felt outdated in a rapidly evolving market. While their service was excellent, their visual identity wasn't connecting with modern customers or brokers. They were losing ground to competitors with fresher, more appealing brands. The disconnect between their quality service and dated appearance was holding back their growth. They needed to look as professional and forward-thinking as they actually were.",
